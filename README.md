# Open Source Template

This is a template repository for Van Ons open source projects. It contains a set of files and folders that are mandatory to use
in order to maintain a single, consistent repository style and layout, as well as additional files and folders that
could be useful, but are not required.

## Usage

1. Download this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `init.sh` script to initialize the repository.
3. Update the `README.md` file with the correct information.
4. Generate a social card and add it as `art/social-card.png`.
5. Set the repository's social media preview to the same header used in `README.md`.
6. Set up the documentation in the `docs` directory.
7. After verifying that everything is correct, delete the `.backup` directory
8. Push the changes to the remote repository.
